# A node CLI game
I made this just to have fun in my spare time

# How to run?
Have the following
- Yarn / Npm (Just for markdown previwer plugin)
- I intentionally didn't use npm for this so you could npm init and install typescript to build it or just have ts-node installed globally
- A terminal that you like (Alacritty is nice though)

Clone the project
```
git clone git@github.com:jcdampil23/nvimConfig.git
```

If you built it yourself you could run it with
```
node ./{build_folder}/init.js
```

If you have ts-node globally
```
ts-node ./init.ts
```
